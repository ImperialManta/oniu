# OniU

**Subscribe. Create. Own.**

OniU is a content platform where creators keep what they earn and fans actually own what they buy — powered by BNB Chain.

## Why OniU?

Most platforms take 30–50% of creator earnings, can suspend accounts without notice, and lock fans out of content they've already paid for.

OniU is different:

- **Creators get paid directly** — earnings go straight to your wallet via smart contract, no middleman holds your money
- **Content you buy stays yours** — purchases are recorded on-chain permanently, nobody can take them away
- **Nothing is stored in plaintext** — all paid content is encrypted in your browser before it ever leaves your device

---

## For Fans

- Browse and subscribe to creators you love
- Pay once for PPV content and keep it forever
- Tip your favourite creators directly
- Receive exclusive encrypted private messages from Premium creators
- All purchases recorded on BNB Chain — accessible anytime

**What you need to get started:**
1. [MetaMask](https://metamask.io) browser wallet
2. A small amount of BNB for transaction fees (~$0.01 per tx)
3. USDT (BEP-20) to subscribe or purchase

## FAQ

**Do I need crypto experience?**
Basic familiarity with MetaMask is enough. If you can send USDT on BNB Chain, you can use OniU.

**What happens if OniU shuts down?**
Content is stored on IPFS, not on OniU servers. Purchases are recorded on-chain. You don't lose access just because the website goes down.

**Can I get a refund?**
Subscriptions are processed directly through a smart contract. Once the payment is distributed to the creator, refunds are not possible.

**Is my wallet safe?**
OniU never has access to your private key. All transactions require explicit approval through MetaMask.

**How do I get USDT on BNB Chain?**
Buy USDT on Binance or OKX and withdraw using the BEP-20 (BNB Smart Chain) network to your MetaMask address.
